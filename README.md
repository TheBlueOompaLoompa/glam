A frontend for the ClamAV antivirus software.

## State of Things
- Very early days
- Don't use this unless all you want is an on/off switch for clamd
- Contributions welcome, but do not expect anything at all, (I do this for fun, not money)
  - Most appreciated thing would be an icon
- Don't bother with translations (yet)

## Why
ClamTk was a great project that went on for many years. Unfortunately, due to
circumstance, the developer made the respectable choice to drop the project
after a long run. Leaving an empty space with nothing* to fill it. So, the
purpose of this project is to create a continuation of what was, from
scratch. As the original developer of ClamTk admitted, it was by no means
perfect, (and I have no idea how to write perl). Plus, while many hate it, I
personally enjoy the look and feel of libadwaita applications.
